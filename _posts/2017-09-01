title: Deploying Django Locally
subtitle: A full walkthrough on Raspberry Pi
---

Django is one of the most popular Python web framework out there, allowing developers to build websites easily without tediously writing similar code for each websites. As a ubiquitous web framework, there are tons of resources on the Internet for deploying on third-party hosting solutions such as PythonAnywhere, Heroku, etc. However there aren't many for hosting on a local physical server, and I have to do alot of research to figure out how everything works, this is my documentation on my learning journey and hopefully it can be of use and improved upon.

For this walkthrough I will be using a Raspberry Pi 3 running on Raspbian, but any Linux distros should work the same (I hope).
